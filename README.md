# Inception Project

## Project Overview

The Inception project is part of the advanced curriculum at 42, focusing on deploying a multi-service application using Docker. This project aims to deepen your understanding of system administration and orchestration by utilizing containerization technologies.

## Objectives

- **Learn Docker**: Understand the basics of Docker, including images, containers, and Docker Compose.
- **Service Deployment**: Deploy multiple services using Docker Compose.
- **Networking**: Configure networking between containers.
- **Data Management**: Manage persistent data using volumes.
- **Security**: Implement basic security practices for containerized applications.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Service Architecture**: Deploy a web application with multiple interconnected services.
- **Container Orchestration**: Use Docker Compose to manage container lifecycle and configuration.
- **Scalability**: Design your system to be easily scalable by adding more containers as needed.
- **Automation**: Automate the setup and deployment process to ensure consistency and reliability.

## Technical Requirements

1. **Docker**: Use Docker to create and manage containers.
2. **Docker Compose**: Define and run multi-container applications with Docker Compose.
3. **Networking**: Set up a network for your containers to communicate securely.
4. **Volumes**: Use volumes to persist data across container restarts.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gain hands-on experience with containerization and orchestration tools.
- Understand how to deploy and manage complex applications in a containerized environment.
- Develop skills in network configuration, data management, and security within Docker ecosystems.
